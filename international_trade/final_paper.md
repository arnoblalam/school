Introduction
=============

The medical tourism indsutry has experienced tremendous growth in recent years.
Exports of medical services by the US (that is foreigners traveling to the US for
medical care) more than tripled in the last decade, from `r min_export` in `r min_epxort_year` to `r max_export` in `r max_export_year`.  New trade theory
proposes that one reason countries engage in trade is that certain industries have
increasing returns to scale.  Given the high levels of capital investements in the 
healthcare industry, this might be a plausible motive for the US to engage in
exports of these services.

This paper examines the effects of increasing levels of export on some ecomomic varaibles in the US ambulatory care and hospital industry, using a vector autoregression (VAR) framework.  The variables examined are wages, employment,
number of establishments, number of firms, and output per worker, establishment
and firm.  Increases in output per worker, establishment or firm would suggest
increasing returns to scale.

The outline for the paper is as follows. Section II reviews existing literature on the topic.  Section III provides a brief overview of the medical tourism industry.
Section IV describes the data and the identification strategy. Section V discusses
the results.
